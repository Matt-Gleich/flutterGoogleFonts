# local_google_fonts ![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/local_google_fonts)

Right now, adding google fonts to your flutter project can take a significant amount of time. This package looks to solve that by streamlining the whole process. All you need to do is add your fonts to your `pubspec.yaml` and run this package (more details below) to have them added to your assets folder and font configuration in your `pubspec.yaml`.

## üöÄ Installing

Simply add `local_google_fonts: ^1.0.5` to your `dev-dependencies`

## üßæ Configuration

Define what fonts you are requesting by adding the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
google_fonts:
  fonts:
    - Roboto
    - Open Sans
```

---

You can also define the weights if you don't want all available versions of a font. For the italicized version of a weight just add `i` to the end of the weight. Make sure that the weight you are requesting exists for that.

```yaml
google_fonts:
  fonts:
    - Roboto:
        - 400
    - Open Sans:
        - "400i"
        - 800
```
